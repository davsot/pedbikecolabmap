Thank you for sharing your knowledge of City streets. Your involvement is key to making the City safer.

Your input will be part of a Borough-wide Vision Zero traffic safety plan. Each borough's plan will outline new safety projects and enforcement strategies to address the issues that you and your neighbors have identified.

Vision Zero workshops and town halls are happening throughout the city. Learn more about upcoming events at http://nyc.gov/visionzero.

Thanks again for your help.
