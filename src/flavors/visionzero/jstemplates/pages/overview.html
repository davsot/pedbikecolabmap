<p>The City of New York must no longer regard traffic crashes as mere “accidents,” but rather as preventable incidents that can be systematically addressed. No level of fatality on city streets is inevitable or acceptable. Vision Zero requires constant input and feedback from citizens and civic organizations.</p>

<p>This map asks for your input on the safety conditions that have been identified as leading contributors to traffic crashes. The information collected on this site will be used to guide proposals in borough-wide traffic safety plans, to be published in 2015.</p>
