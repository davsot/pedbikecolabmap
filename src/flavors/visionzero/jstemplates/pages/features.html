<p>Every year, approximately 4,000 New Yorkers are seriously injured and more than 250 are killed in traffic crashes. Being struck by a vehicle is the leading cause of injury-related death for children under 14, and the second leading cause for seniors. On average, vehicles seriously injure or kill a New Yorker every two hours.</p>

<p>Vision Zero is the City's goal for ending traffic deaths and injuries on our streets. To accomplish this, we need everyone’s participation and input.</p>

<p>Use this interactive map to share your experiences with city streets. Your knowledge will be used to create a traffic safety plan that will describe how to make each borough’s streets safer for everyone, whether walking, biking or driving.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/visionzero/pages/dialogue/events.html" title="Events - Vision Zero">You're also invited to a Vision Zero workshop to share your ideas</a>.</p>
